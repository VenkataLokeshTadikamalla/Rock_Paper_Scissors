# Rock_Paper_Scissors
 This repository includes code that enables us to use a computer to play ROCK-PAPER-SCISSOR. A hand game called rock, paper, scissors is often played by two players. In this game, rock can beat scissors, paper can beat scissors, and scissors can beat rock. This code is developed in Python; conditional statements and the random library were used.
